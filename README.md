# Breast-cancer-analysis-

Breast Cancer is one of the most frequent diseases and the top cause of mortality for most people around the world. Although many people who have breast cancer have no family history, women who have blood relatives who have had the disease are more likely to get it. In addition, other factors such as aging, genes, dense breast tissues, obesity, and radiation exposure all increase the chance of breast cancer. Therefore, early detection of breast cancer improves the chances of survival by allowing patients to receive timely clinical treatment. Machine learning (ML) is widely regarded as the approach of choice in breast cancer pattern classification and forecast modeling due to its unique benefits in detecting essential characteristics from complex disease datasets.
